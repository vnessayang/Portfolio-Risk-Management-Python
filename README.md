Portfolio Risk Management of Palantir Technologies: A Quantitative Analysis Using Python
This repository presents an academically structured analysis of the risk profile of Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and its comparison with selected asset classes. The project demonstrates the application of quantitative finance, statistical modeling, and Python-based analytics. It is prepared as part of a broader portfolio supporting my application for a Master’s degree in international Master of Finance (iMF) Zhejiang University.
1. Purpose of the Project

This project was developed to strengthen my academic preparation in quantitative analysis and financial modeling. By integrating statistical methods with Python programming, the study aims to:
Demonstrate technical competence in evaluating financial risk,
Show capability in constructing and analyzing portfolios,
Apply econometric techniques to real-world financial data,
Build reproducible, research-grade workflows.
This project reflects the analytical foundation I intend to expand in postgraduate study.

2. Executive Summary

Using daily price data, the project evaluates Palantir’s individual risk profile, constructs a multi-asset portfolio, and employs multiple regression analysis to explain and forecast stock returns. The workflow replicates industry-standard practices used in quantitative finance, investment analysis, and risk management.
The study illustrates my ability to:
Translate financial concepts into computational models,
Analyze uncertainty using statistical measures,
Apply regression techniques to identify meaningful predictors,
Communicate findings clearly through structured computation and visualization.

3. Methodology Overview
3.1 Data Acquisition
Historical market data were retrieved using Python-based data access tools (e.g., yfinance). Assets were selected to allow cross-comparison between equity and other classifications.

3.2 Individual Risk Assessment
The analysis includes:
Daily return calculation
Variance and standard deviation,
Value at Risk (95%),
Distribution diagnostics,
These metrics form the foundation for understanding asset-level risk.

3.3 Portfolio Construction and Risk Evaluation
A multi-asset portfolio is built to examine:
Covariance and correlation relationships,
Portfolio variance using the Markowitz framework,
Sensitivity of risk to weight allocation,
Comparative stability versus individual asset holdings.

3.4 Multiple Regression Modeling
An Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model is developed to:
Identify variables influencing Palantir’s returns,
Evaluate statistical significance and model fit,
Provide preliminary prediction insights for forward-looking analysis,
The modeling process reflects graduate-level econometric reasoning.
